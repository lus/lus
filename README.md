## Hello, my friend!

My name is Lukas, I am 17 years old, and I do some programming in my spare time.
I've been into computer science since ~2017 now, and I love learning new stuff.

* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/)
* [Go](https://go.dev)
* [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) (basic knowledge; want to learn more soon)

### Other technologies I like to use:

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Redis](https://redis.io/)
* [NATS](https://nats.io/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### General topics I am interested and (kind of) experienced in:

* DevOps
* CI/CD
* Systems administration
* Data structures
* Backends
* Infrastructure planning

### Projects I am mainly working on and/or contributing to:

* [pasty](https://github.com/lus/pasty): A simple yet beautiful code pasting server
