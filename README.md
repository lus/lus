## Hello, my friend!

My name is Lukas and most of my friends call me Lukas, but you can also call me Lukas if you want.
I am a 16 year old student from Germany who does some programming in his free time to gain some knowledge for his future life and working career.

I got into programming back in 2016/2017 and started with some C# on my fathers laptop (it wasn't really programming though as I needed to ask him stuff like 'how to open this window?' or 'what is an integer?', but you get the point. I started gaining interest back then).

### Programming languages I (kind of) mastered or at least plan to:

* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/)
* [Go](https://go.dev)
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (currently learning)
* [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) (planning)

### Other technologies I like to use:

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Redis](https://redis.io/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### General topics I am interested and experienced in:

* DevOps
* CI/CD
* Systems administration in general
* Data structures
* Backends
* Infrastructure planning

### Projects I am mainly working at and/or contributing to:

* [pasty](https://github.com/lus/pasty): A simple yet beautiful code pasting server
* [x0](https://github.com/x0tf): A modern and privacy-focused stuff sharing service
* [poopmail](https://github.com/poopmail): An over-engineered temp-mail service
