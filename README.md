## Hello, my friend!

My name is Lukas but most of my friends call me Lukas. If you want you can also call me Lukas instead.
I am a 17 year old student from Germany who does some programming in his free time to gain some knowledge for his future life and working career.

Even though my interest into programming arised already in 2015/2016, I started my first projects in 2017 when I played the game Minecraft and discovered I could develop plugins for a server implementation of it.
I have moved forward since then and I try to keep learning new stuff :D

### Programming languages I (kind of) mastered or at least plan to:

* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/)
